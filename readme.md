Together, Dart and Flutter enable developers to build high-quality cross-platform applications with a single codebase.

Why is updating the PATH environment variable important for both Dart and Flutter installations? How does it affect the usage of these tools?
Updating the PATH environment variable is crucial because it allows your operating system to locate the Dart and Flutter executables from any command line interface. Without adding these tools to the PATH, you would need to navigate to their installation directories each time you want to run commands like dart, flutter, or flutter doctor.

By adding them to the PATH, you can easily use these tools globally in your system, simplifying development and ensuring that all related commands function correctly.

How does verifying the installation of Dart and Flutter ensure that the setup process has been successful?
Verifying the installation of Dart and Flutter by running commands like `flutter doctor` ensures that the setup process has been successful. It checks for all necessary components, configurations, and dependencies, confirming that everything is correctly installed and ready for development. This step helps identify and resolve any issues early on.

What are the expected outcomes for the dart --version and flutter doctor commands?
- `dart --version`: Displays the installed version of Dart, confirming that Dart is correctly installed and accessible from the command line.

- `flutter doctor`: Provides a comprehensive report on the Flutter installation, listing any missing dependencies or configuration issues. A successful outcome shows green checkmarks indicating that all components are properly installed and configured.
What is the purpose of the flutter doctor command in the Flutter installation process?
The flutter doctor command checks the Flutter installation and environment, identifying any missing dependencies or configuration issues. It provides a detailed report on whether all required tools (like the Dart SDK, Android Studio, etc.) are installed and correctly configured, guiding you through fixing any issues to ensure your Flutter setup is fully operational.
How does it help ensure a smooth development experience?
The flutter doctor command ensures a smooth development experience by identifying and resolving potential issues in your development environment before you start coding. It checks for all necessary tools, SDKs, and configurations, helping you address any missing components or errors upfront. This proactive approach prevents problems that could disrupt development later, allowing you to focus on building your app without unexpected interruptions.
